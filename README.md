"Is it_colder this winter compared to last??!"
=========================================

Everyone is grumbling about how cold this winter has been. I decided to write a Processing sketch to answer the question "Is this winter colder than last winter??!".


##Data Sources##
I started out using the noise function to provide dummy data. This was useful to test out the representation first.

Next I tried working with NOAA data. It seems a bit messy.

My next data source alternative is to try using data from the Canadian federal government's [Weather office](http://climate.weather.gc.ca/climateData/dailydata_e.html?timeframe=2&Prov=ONT&StationID=30247&dlyRange=2006-01-01|2014-03-29&Year=2013&Month=3&Day=01).
