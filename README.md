Is_it_colder_this_winter_compared_to_last
=========================================

Everyone is grumbling about how cold this winter has been. I decided to write a Processing sketch to answer the question "Is this winter colder than last winter??!".


##Data Source##
I started out using the noise function to provide dummy data. This was useful to test out the representation first.

Next I tried working with NOAA data. It seems a bit messy.

Now I'm going to try using data from the Canadian federal government's (Weather office)[http://climate.weather.gc.ca/climateData/dailydata_e.html?timeframe=2&Prov=ONT&StationID=30247&dlyRange=2006-01-01|2014-03-29&Year=2013&Month=3&Day=01].
